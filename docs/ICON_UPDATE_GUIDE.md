# App Icon Update Guide

## Current Configuration

The app.json has been updated to use separate files for the app icon and splash screen:

- **App Icon**: `./assets/icon.png` (the rocket logo)
- **Splash Screen**: `./assets/logo.png` (keeps current logo)
- **Android Adaptive Icon**: `./assets/adaptive-icon.png` (rocket logo without background)

## Steps to Complete Icon Update

### 1. Prepare Your Icon Images

You need to create these files from your rocket logo image:

#### Required Files:
- `assets/icon.png` - 1024x1024px (main app icon)
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` - 1024x1024px (Android adaptive icon, foreground only)

### 2. Use an Icon Generator (Recommended)

**Option A: Online Tool**
1. Go to https://www.appicon.co/ or https://easyappicon.com/
2. Upload your rocket logo image
3. Download the generated icons
4. Copy `icon.png` (1024x1024) to `assets/icon.png`
5. Copy `adaptive-icon.png` to `assets/adaptive-icon.png`

**Option B: Manual Resize**
1. Open your rocket logo in an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Resize to 1024x1024px
3. Save as `icon.png` in the `assets` folder
4. For adaptive icon, remove the background and save as `adaptive-icon.png`

### 3. Icon Specifications

#### Main Icon (`icon.png`)
- Size: 1024x1024px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Content: Full rocket logo with colors
- Background: Can include background or be transparent

#### Adaptive Icon (`adaptive-icon.png`)
- Size: 1024x1024px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Content: Rocket logo only (foreground)
- Background: Transparent (background color is set in app.json as #A78BFA)
- Safe Area: Keep important content within center 66% (avoid edges)

### 4. File Structure

```
assets/
├── icon.png              ← NEW: Rocket logo for app icon (1024x1024)
├── adaptive-icon.png     ← NEW: Rocket logo for Android adaptive (1024x1024)
├── logo.png              ← KEEP: Current logo for splash screen
├── splash.png            ← Optional
└── favicon.png           ← Keep as is
```

### 5. Verify Configuration

The app.json is already configured correctly:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/logo.png"
    },
    "ios": {
      "icon": "./assets/icon.png"
    },
    "android": {
      "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#A78BFA"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Test Locally

After adding the icon files:

```bash
# Clear cache
npx expo start -c

# Test on device
npx expo start
```

### 7. Build for Production

```bash
# Build Android APK
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Build iOS (if needed)
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## Design Tips for App Icons

### Do's:
✅ Use high contrast colors
✅ Keep design simple and recognizable
✅ Make sure icon is visible at small sizes
✅ Use the rocket logo's vibrant colors (purple, cyan, pink)
✅ Ensure icon looks good on both light and dark backgrounds

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't include text (it won't be readable at small sizes)
❌ Don't use photos or complex gradients
❌ Don't place important elements near edges (for adaptive icons)
❌ Don't use too many colors

## Android Adaptive Icon

Android adaptive icons have two layers:
1. **Foreground**: Your rocket logo (adaptive-icon.png)
2. **Background**: Solid color (#A78BFA - purple from your theme)

The system can mask and animate these layers, so keep important content in the safe zone (center 66%).

## Icon Sizes Generated by Expo

When you build, Expo automatically generates all required sizes:
- Android: 48dp, 72dp, 96dp, 144dp, 192dp
- iOS: 20pt, 29pt, 40pt, 60pt, 76pt, 83.5pt, 1024pt

You only need to provide the 1024x1024 source images.

## Troubleshooting

### Icon not updating?
1. Clear Expo cache: `npx expo start -c`
2. Uninstall and reinstall the app
3. Clear build cache: `eas build --clear-cache`

### Icon looks blurry?
- Ensure source image is exactly 1024x1024px
- Use PNG format with high quality
- Don't upscale a smaller image

### Adaptive icon looks cut off?
- Keep important content within center 66% (684x684px safe zone)
- Test with different Android launcher shapes (circle, square, rounded)
